This is a date calculator that calculates the number of days between two dates, over any number of years in the A.D. range.  It takes into account leap years and uses no external date libraries.  It simply uses logic to solve date problems.  This was built for a Java programming class.  The main method has hard coded a few dates to showcase the functionality, but the code can be easily modified to fit a wide range of functionality.

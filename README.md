This is a date calculator that calculates the number of days between two dates, over any number of years in the A.D. range.  It takes into account leap years and uses minimal external date libraries. This was built for a Java programming class and should not be used in lieu of robust community supported libraries.  The main method has hard coded a few dates to showcase the functionality, but the code can be easily modified to fit a wide range of functionality.
